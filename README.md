# Spring-2022
Repo for the ENGR122 and CSC 132 design project, "Whiteboard Walley".

It contains the programs and other files that are used in said programs.

Its contents and descriptions are as follows.

The Walley GUI

Contains the GUI for our project along with the Bluetooth integration that was cut due to countless errors and time constraints. We used classes to implement all our Tkinter frames. We tried to create a menu system that would be a good concept for an app later down the road. Our overall plan for the GUI/Bluetooth is to integrate our own Bluetooth system into an app for mobile devices. Included are images that are used to help liven up the GUI, because we believed it to be bland.

Arduino code

This contains the functionality of the “Walley” robot and the Bluetooth that is present in our final design. It allows for it to control the robot’s movements automatically and manually. It incorporates a sprayer control system where we can manually control the spray of the robot and allow for automatic spraying. For Bluetooth control we are using the Dabble library and all its features. We also use the Servo library, because we are implementing four servos in our project. 
The code is simple to understand. We tried to write and comment our code so that we can make it easy for the reader to understand.
